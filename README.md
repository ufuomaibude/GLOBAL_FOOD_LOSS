# Global_Food_Loss
Conducted a data-driven analysis of global food loss and waste at the production stage, using visual analytics to uncover key patterns and support sustainable, waste-reducing strategies.

# Sections of Group Research Project and their Contributions
•	Introduction & Background: Outlined the global impact of food waste, highlighting economic, environmental, and logistical challenges.
•	Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Enabled us to work with a refined dataset of 24,845 rows. Categorizing commodities was critical to enabling comparative visualizations across food groups like grains, dairy, fruits, etc.
•	Visual Analytics: Identified top food-wasting countries (USA, India, Kenya). Pinpointed grains as the most wasted commodity globally, especially in African countries. Highlighted the production activities (storage, drying, transportation) most responsible for losses—together accounting for 96% of production stage losses. Showed yearly trends, identifying 2013 as the peak year for food loss, and linked lower losses in 2020 to COVID-related disruptions.

•	Evaluation of Methodological Limitations: The reliance on modelled estimates (over 19,000 out of 24,000+ entries) was critically analyzed. We noted the lack of field-level empirical data, especially for perishable goods, which may skew accuracy and policy applicability.
•	Conclusion: Synthesized key insights and emphasized the role of data visualization in uncovering systemic inefficiencies in global food systems. It also underscored the potential of AI and ML technologies to predict and prevent such losses at scale.

# Project Objectives 
•	To identify key countries and food categories with the highest levels of food waste.
•	To determine at which stages of the food supply chain loss is most prevalent.
•	To analyze the relationship between food types, activities, and waste volumes using big data visualization tools.
•	To assess the reliability and sources of the available data, and reflect on the role of modelled estimates in FLW studies.
•	To use Power BI and Python visualizations to support actionable insights for industry and policy stakeholders.

# Methods and Tools
The project employed a combination of:
•	Data cleaning and transformation using Python (Google Colab).
•	Categorization of commodities into major food groups for meaningful analysis.
•	Visualization using Power BI to display trends, distributions, and cross-country comparisons.
•	Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to detect patterns in activity types and stages of the supply chain contributing to waste.

# Key Findings
•	Grains were the most wasted commodity globally, with the highest losses in Africa.
•	Fruits were the most wasted commodity in the United Kingdom.
•	Farm-level activities accounted for the highest volume of losses.
•	Top contributors to food waste included storage and transportation, accounting for over 60% of production-stage losses.
•	Data limitations: The dominance of modelled estimates (19,310 out of 24,845 data points) over experimental or observational data raises concerns about accuracy and regional representativeness.

# Recommendations and Impact
•	Policy Interventions: Governments should prioritize investments in storage infrastructure, cold chains, and transport systems to reduce post-harvest losses.
•	Technology Adoption: Support the integration of AI and ML in predictive analysis of spoilage and optimization of distribution routes.
•	Data Improvements: Encourage use of field experiments and observational studies to complement modelled datasets.
•	Stakeholder Awareness: Use interactive dashboards to raise awareness among food managers, agricultural stakeholders, and consumers.
•	Improve post-harvest infrastructure, especially for grains and perishables.
•	Invest in primary data collection (field surveys, case studies) for better FLW tracking.
•	Develop country-specific strategies, especially for high-waste regions like the USA, China, and India.
•	Educate farmers and supply chain workers on food preservation and storage methods.
•	Enforce policies targeting waste reduction at key supply chain stages.

# Conclusion
This research illuminated critical patterns in food loss across global supply chains and revealed the potential of data visualization in driving sustainable food management practices. Through comprehensive analysis of a large FAO dataset, our group contributed valuable insights into the systemic inefficiencies responsible for food loss, particularly in grains and perishables. The findings underscore the need for real-time monitoring, improved infrastructure, and a shift from reliance on modelled estimates to more robust, empirical data sources. This project has equipped me with practical skills in big data visualization, critical thinking, and collaborative research preparing me for rigorous doctoral work at the intersection of sustainability, technology, and data science.
